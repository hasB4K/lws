  Configuring roles (prefill, decode, encode) and their independent pod specifications in DisaggregatedSet.
---

A **Role** in DisaggregatedSet represents a distinct operational phase in a disaggregated serving architecture (e.g., `prefill`, `decode`, or `encode`). Each role defines its own pod specifications, scaling properties, and replica topology.

## Relationship to Child LeaderWorkerSets

Each role defined in a `DisaggregatedSet` specification maps directly to an independent child `LeaderWorkerSet` managed by the DisaggregatedSet controller:

```
DisaggregatedSet "my-inference"
├── roles[0]: prefill  →  LeaderWorkerSet "my-inference-0-<rev>-prefill"
├── roles[1]: decode   →  LeaderWorkerSet "my-inference-0-<rev>-decode"
└── roles[2]: encode   →  LeaderWorkerSet "my-inference-0-<rev>-encode"
```

Child LeaderWorkerSets follow the naming convention:
`<DisaggregatedSet-name>-<slice>-<revision-hash>-<role-name>`

{{% alert title="Note" color="info" %}}
The revision hash in the child resource name is dynamic across updates. Always select child resources using Kubernetes labels (`disaggregatedset.x-k8s.io/name`, `disaggregatedset.x-k8s.io/role`, `disaggregatedset.x-k8s.io/slice`) rather than hardcoding names.

## Role Configuration Fields

A `DisaggregatedSet` spec defines a `roles` list where each entry represents a role (`DisaggregatedRoleSpec`):

| Field | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `name` | `string` | Unique name for this role within the set (e.g., `prefill`, `decode`, `encode`). |
| `scaling` | `RoleScaling` | Optional scaling configuration. `scaling.mode: External` delegates replica management to an external autoscaler (e.g., HPA/KEDA via `DisaggregatedSetRoleScaler`). Default is `Static`. |
| `spec.replicas` | `*int32` | Number of LWS replicas (pod groups) for this role per slice. |
| `spec.leaderWorkerTemplate` | `LeaderWorkerTemplate` | Full pod template defining the leader and worker pod containers, resource requests/limits, restart policies, and subgroup configurations for this role. |
| `spec.rolloutStrategy` | `RolloutStrategy` | Optional rolling update configuration for this role. DisaggregatedSet coordinates updates across roles to maintain capacity ratios. |

## Example Multi-Role Configuration

Here is an example `DisaggregatedSet` defining independent `prefill` and `decode` roles with different pod group sizes and hardware accelerator configurations:

## Independent Per-Role Capabilities

Because each role maps to an independent child LeaderWorkerSet, each role inherits all core LWS features tailored to its specific workload phase:

1. **Heterogeneous Hardware:**
   Prefill servers can run on high-bandwidth, high-compute accelerator nodes (e.g., 8-GPU tensor-parallel groups), while decode servers run on memory-optimized nodes (e.g., 2-GPU or 4-GPU groups).
2. **Independent Group Sizes:**
   Each role configures its own `leaderWorkerTemplate.size` and optional `subGroupPolicy`.
3. **Independent Autoscaling:**
   Prefill and decode roles can be scaled dynamically based on distinct metric signals (e.g., time-to-first-token vs. inter-token-latency) using `DisaggregatedSetRoleScaler`.
4. **Dedicated Storage:**
   Each role can configure its own `volumeClaimTemplates` for local model caching or intermediate tensor offloading.

## Virtual roles

`subRoles: [{name: interactive, replicas: 3}, {name: batch, replicas: 1}]` partitions
one parent's shared-template LWS into routing pools, totaling four groups per slice.
Parent `spec.replicas` is ignored and parent `scaling` must be omitted. Children may
use `scaling.mode: External` without `replicas`; their `<ds>-<parent>-<child>` RoleScalers
retain the single-slice restriction. Both Ordinal and Hash group identities are supported.

Route using the controller-owned `disaggregatedset.x-k8s.io/subrole` Pod label alongside
set/role/slice labels. Each child inherits independent rollout budgets; there is no parent cap.
`status.roleStatuses` lists the parent aggregate then `parent/child` entries for current children:
use totals or breakdown, not both. `SubRolesAssigned` reports coherent group assignment.
Labels can briefly duplicate during transfers. Ordinal requires a healthy retained prefix;
Hash preserves the accepted per-child Ready floors. Pending operations block further planning
and desired changes until they complete.

Assigned Hash leaders carry UID-bound `leaderworkerset.sigs.k8s.io/scale-protection`
annotations. A DELETE-only webhook rejects stale native victim choices; accepted exact-UID
scale victims and native health replacements are allowed. Terminal/terminating leaders
bypass it. Parent teardown requires the endpoint to be online; an administrative override
removes the leader's protection annotation before deletion. Removing subroles finishes
accepted work and clears protection with assignments.

for assignment ordering, recovery, rollout churn, and removing subroles.
